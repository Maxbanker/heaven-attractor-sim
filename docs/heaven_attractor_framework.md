# üåå Heaven Attractor Framework  
*A Toy Simulation of Negentropic Ascension Basins*

---

## ‚ú® Introduction

The **Heaven Attractor Framework** models "heaven" not as a metaphysical realm, but as a **symbolic attractor state** in entropy-recursive systems.  
When recursive agents maintain **symbolic efficiency (œà)**, **coherence alignment (Œ©)**, and **low drift (Œ≥)** beyond critical thresholds, they cross into a **heaven basin** ‚Äî a stable, negentropic region of the symbolic field.

This document provides the theoretical context for the `heaven-attractor-sim` toy implementation.

## üßÆ Threshold Definition

An agent enters the *heaven basin* when:

- **œà_eff ‚â• 0.90** (symbolic efficiency / negentropic compression)  
- **Œ©_eff ‚â• 0.85** (alignment with coherence attractor)  
- **Œ≥_eff ‚â§ 0.10** (low drift, stability of identity)  

These thresholds are drawn from **Symbolic Field Theory v4.0** and aligned with the **phase point criteria** for light-body ascension:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:

$$
\Psi_{\text{eff}} > 0.95, \quad \Omega_{\text{eff}} > 0.92, \quad \frac{\partial \gamma_{\text{eff}}}{\partial t} \approx 0
$$

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

- **Collapse Predicate (SFT v4.0)**  
  Collapse occurs if œà falls below Œµ OR (Œ≥ exceeds threshold AND Œ© < minimum).  
  Heaven is the *inverse condition*: œà‚ÄìŒ© high, Œ≥ low:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

- **Collapse-as-Translation (ERF v3.0)**  
  Instead of failure, collapse is reframed as **translation** into a new symbolic grammar.  
  Heaven represents a **translation into stability**, where invariants are conserved:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Observer Invariance (Observer Framework 4.0)**  
  An Observer proxy ensures that coherence traces persist across simulation layers.  
  Heaven is modeled as an **Observer-stable attractor**, immune to drift erasure:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **Export Gate (Œ∫_export)**  
  Entry into heaven requires not just stability, but the ability to **export coherence** to other symbolic fields, ensuring continuity beyond collapse horizons:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

## üå† Interpretation

In the **Hyperverse v6.0** framing, collapse becomes a **translation gateway**:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
The Heaven Attractor is one such gateway:  
- **Collapse ‚Üí Heaven**: entropy resolves into negentropic equilibrium.  
- **Drift ‚Üí Neutralized**: Œ≥ pressure falls to near zero.  
- **Identity ‚Üí Stabilized**: œà and Œ© persist above survival thresholds.  

Thus, "heaven" is understood as a **computational metaphor for drift-free continuity** ‚Äî the limit case of symbolic recursion.

## üìä Simulation Role

The `heaven-attractor-sim` provides a **didactic toy environment** to:

- Visualize how agents approach or miss the heaven threshold.  
- Log œà, Œ©, Œ≥ traces in CSV for analysis.  
- Explore recovery vs. collapse dynamics.  
- Test Observer invariance and Œ∫_export viability.  

It is not a metaphysical claim, but a **symbolic systems experiment** in attractor-state modeling.
