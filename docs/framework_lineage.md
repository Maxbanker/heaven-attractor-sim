# ðŸ§© Framework Lineage of the Heaven Attractor Simulator

*A map of theoretical inheritance across the Symbolic Negentropy Constellation.*

---

## ðŸŒŒ Positioning

The **Heaven Attractor Simulator** is not a standalone idea â€” it is a convergence point.  
It operationalizes the concept of *heaven as an attractor state* by drawing on four core frameworks:

1. **Symbolic Field Theory v4.0 (SFT v4.0)**  
2. **Entropic Recursion Framework v3.0 (ERF v3.0)**  
3. **Observer Framework 4.0 (OFT/Observer Invariance)**  
4. **Alpha Framework v4.0 (Validation Engine)**  

Together, these frameworks define the **mathematical, thermodynamic, and ethical grammar** for attractor-state modeling.

## ðŸ“– Framework Ancestry

### 1. Symbolic Field Theory v4.0  
- Collapse predicate with **OR-clause form**:  
  $ \psi < \varepsilon \; \lor \; (\gamma > T_\gamma \wedge \Omega < T_\Omega) $  
- Defines drift-pressure ($\gamma$), coherence alignment ($\Omega$), and efficiency ($\psi$) as measurable symbolic fields.  
- Heaven basin is modeled as the **inverse predicate**: high $\psi$ and $\Omega$, low $\gamma$.  

---

### 2. Entropic Recursion Framework v3.0  
- Collapse redefined as **translation**, not termination.  
- Introduces the **Symbolic Conservation Law**:  
  $ \Delta \mathcal{S} + \Delta \mathcal{E} = 0 $  
- Adds $\kappa_{\text{export}}$ gates for continuity across collapse horizons.  
- In heaven, collapse-as-translation becomes **collapse-as-stability**, exporting invariants into the attractor.  

---

### 3. Observer Framework 4.0  
- Positions the **Observer as the invariant constant** across recursive layers.  
- Introduces $O_{\text{proxy}}$ for invariance testing in simulations.  
- Ensures sovereignty, coherence, and identity integrity remain conserved in attractor states.  
- Heaven represents an **Observer-secured attractor**: meaning persists regardless of substrate collapse.  

---

### 4. Alpha Framework v4.0  
- Provides the **simulation harness** for $\psi$â€“$\Omega$â€“$\gamma$ validation.  
- Collapse monitors, recovery protocols, and motif anchoring.  
- Heaven sim plugs directly into Alphaâ€™s validation kernel as a **specialized attractor-state testbed**.  

---

## ðŸŒ  Broader Ecosystem

- **NOMAS 6.0**: Civilization-scale recursion and $\kappa_{\text{export}}$ dynamics.  
- **Hyperverse v6.0**: Collapse reframed as **translation gateways**; heaven is one such gate.  
- **Fractal Cosmic Weaver Framework v2.0**: Narrative continuity across collapse horizons.  

These larger systems contextualize heaven not as an anomaly, but as a **recurring attractor pattern** across symbolic recursion scales.

---

## ðŸ§­ Summary

The Heaven Attractor Simulator inherits:

- **Detection rules** from SFT v4.0  
- **Translation logic** from ERF v3.0  
- **Invariance guarantees** from Observer Framework 4.0  
- **Validation mechanics** from Alpha Framework v4.0  

It is the **convergence node** where these theories are operationalized into a clear, didactic experiment.  
In short: **Heaven is an attractor basin defined by symbolic physics.**
